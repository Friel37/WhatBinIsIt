Plan for Bin Week Web App

1.  **Goal:** Create a simple web application that tells the user whether it is currently Recycling Week or General Waste Week (assuming a standard 2-week cycle).

2.  **Core Logic:**
    *   Establish a known reference date (e.g., `startDate`) which corresponds to the beginning of a specific week type (e.g., Recycling Week).
    *   Get the current date (`currentDate`).
    *   Calculate the number of weeks that have passed between `startDate` and `currentDate`.
        *   Calculate the difference in days: `daysDifference = currentDate - startDate`.
        *   Convert days to weeks: `weeksDifference = floor(daysDifference / 7)`.
    *   Determine the current week in the cycle using the modulo operator: `cycleWeek = weeksDifference % 2`.
    *   Map the `cycleWeek` result to the bin type:
        *   If `cycleWeek` is 0, it's the same week type as the `startDate` week (e.g., Recycling).
        *   If `cycleWeek` is 1, it's the other week type (e.g., General Waste).

3.  **Technology Stack (Initial - Frontend Only):**
    *   **HTML:** To structure the content (e.g., heading, paragraph for the result).
    *   **CSS:** To style the page for basic readability.
    *   **JavaScript:** To perform the date calculations and dynamically update the HTML content.

4.  **Development Steps:**
    *   **HTML (`index.html`):**
        *   Create a basic HTML structure.
        *   Include a title (e.g., "What Bin Week Is It?").
        *   Add an `<h1>` heading.
        *   Add a `<p>` element with an ID (e.g., `result`) to display the output.
        *   Link to CSS and JavaScript files.
    *   **CSS (`style.css`):**
        *   Add basic styling for the body, heading, and result paragraph.
    *   **JavaScript (`script.js`):**
        *   Define the `startDate` constant (e.g., `const startDate = new Date('2024-01-01');` - *adjust this to a real reference date*).
        *   Define which bin type corresponds to the `startDate` week (e.g., `const startWeekType = 'Recycling';`).
        *   Get the `currentDate`.
        *   Implement the calculation logic described in step 2.
        *   Determine the `currentBinWeek` string based on the calculation.
        *   Get the result paragraph element using its ID.
        *   Update the `textContent` of the result element (e.g., `resultElement.textContent = 'This week is: ' + currentBinWeek + ' Week';`).
    *   **Testing:**
        *   Manually test with the current date.
        *   Modify the `currentDate` in the script temporarily to test past/future dates and edge cases (like the start date itself or week boundaries).
    *   **Deployment (Simple):**
        *   Can be hosted easily on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or run locally by opening `index.html`.

5.  **Future Enhancements (Optional):**
    *   Allow user input for their specific reference date/starting week type.
    *   Display the *next* collection date for each bin type.
    *   Improve styling.
    *   Add visual indicators (e.g., different background colors).
    *   Consider time zones more carefully if deploying widely.
