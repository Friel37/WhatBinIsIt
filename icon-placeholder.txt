To create the necessary icons for your PWA:

1. Create two PNG files:
   - icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
   - icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

2. Design recommendations:
   - Use a simple, recognizable design (perhaps a recycling bin or trash bin icon)
   - Use contrasting colors that stand out on both light and dark backgrounds
   - Keep the design simple and legible even at small sizes

3. You can create these icons using:
   - Canva (free online tool)
   - GIMP or Photoshop
   - Online PWA icon generators
   - Or use a service like IconKitchen (https://icon.kitchen/)

4. Once created, place these files in the same directory as your index.html file

If you prefer a temporary solution, you can find free icon sets on sites like:
- https://icons8.com/
- https://thenounproject.com/
- https://www.flaticon.com/

Just make sure you follow licensing requirements for any icons you use!
